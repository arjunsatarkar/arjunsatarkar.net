## Usage

Prerequisites:
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

Provide the `PORT` environment variable at runtime to set a port (default 8000).

Build with environment variable PROXIED=1 to use the X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port, and X-Forwarded-Proto
headers. Ensure that the proxy actually sets these.

Interactive:
```
iex -S mix
```

Development:
```
mix run --no-halt
```

Release:
```
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
_build/prod/rel/www_arjunsatarkar_net/bin/www_arjunsatarkar_net start
